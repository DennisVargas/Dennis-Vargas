## Building Experiences with Design, Code & Music 🎮👨🏽‍💻🎵
I'm Dennis Vargas, a passionate Creative Technologist weaving immersive experiences where code meets function and fun. ✨

I am on a creative mission to:
- Craft interactive worlds that come alive with engaging mechanics, color, and sound.
- Compose captivating soundtracks that tell stories without words.
- Develop innovative apps that simplify the gap between technology, art, and life.

Right now, I'm building Pantry Planner, an AI-powered meal planner and grocery list app designed to saving you time from planning to plating. Using Java Spring and powered by Lambda's serverless functions, Pantry Planner seamlessly executes its AI-powered recipe engine, crafting personalized meals based on your preferences. I'm also always keeping my game development skills sharp and have just begun a journey into developing games with Godot.

You are welcome to follow along in my journey blending pixels, function, time saving & artistic harmony! Explore my projects, [email](mailto:dvargas.software@gmail.com) me to collaborate on something cool, or just say hi!
