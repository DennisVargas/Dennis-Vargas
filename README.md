# Dennis Vargas: Building Experiences with Design, Code & Music 🎮👨🏽‍💻🎵
I'm Dennis Vargas, a passionate Creative Technologist weaving immersive experiences where code meets function and fun. ✨

I am on a creative mission to:
- Craft interactive worlds that come alive with engaging mechanics, color, and sound.
- Compose captivating soundtracks that tell stories without words.
- Develop innovative apps that simplify the gap between technology, art, and life.

Right now, I'm building Pantry Planner, an AI-powered meal planner and grocery list app designed to simplify your kitchen orchestration. Using Java Spring and a dash of AWS magic (Lambda & DynamoDB), Pantry Planner will learn your preferences and create delicious, personalized meal plans with ease. Stay tuned for updates on development!
